# Algorithms & Data structures

### Objective of the repo
Contain implementations and notes about algorithms and data structures.

### Implementations
- priority queue
  - Binary heap
- sorting (benchmarked):
  - raddix sort
  - mergesort
  - quicksort
- Binary search tree:
  - AVL
- Hashtable;
  - hashing using modulus with prime number
  - Deal with collision using chaining
- Graph:
  - represented using adjacency list
  - BFS
  - DFS
